							<p>
								Hi there! I'm finishing my PhD in Mathematics at Rice University, specializing in quantum algebra and category theory. You can check out my research interests and publications in the Research section!
								
								I'm a big fan of both machine and human learning! You can find some past data science projects in the Portfolio section, or find more about my teaching experience in the Teaching section.
					
								When I'm not doing working, you'll probably find me taking care of my cats or my garden.
